# Strava_Bias_Correction
The code in this repository is used to predict bicycle ridership after correcting bias in crowdsourced bicycling data from Strava using LASSO &amp; Poisson Regression.The study area is Maricopa County, Arizona. The predictions are based on bicycle counts from 2016 provided by the Maricopa Association of Governments. We predict overall annual average daily bicyclist count for the city of Tempe & categorize the streets into 5 classes as shown in the map below.
